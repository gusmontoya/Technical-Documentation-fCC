              <h2>What is a Version Control System (VCS)</h2>
              <p>
                A version control system, or VCS, provides an automatic way to track changes in software projects, 
                giving creators the power to view previous versions of files and directories, develop speculative 
                features without disrupting the main development, securely back up the project and its history, and 
                collaborate easily and conveniently with others. In addition, using version control also makes 
                deploying production websites and web applications much easier.
              </p>
              <p>
                Version control has evolved considerably over the years. The family line leading to Git 
                includes programs called RCS, CVS, and Subversion, and there are many current alternatives 
                as well, including Perforce, Bazaar, and Mercurial. I mention these examples not because you 
                need to know what they are, but only to show what a bewildering variety there is. What’s worse,
                when you choose a version control system, you really commit to it, and it is often difficult 
                to switch from one to another. Happily, in the last few years an undisputed winner has emerged 
                in the open-source VCS wars: Git. This, tutorial will provide a useful introduction to the 
                subject.
              </p>
              <p>
                Originally developed by Linux creator Linus Torvalds to host the Linux kernel, Git is a command-line
                program that is designed in the Unix tradition (which is why a familiarity with the Unix command line
                is an important prerequisite). Git has a combination of power, speed, and community adoption that leave
                it few rivals, but it can be tricky to learn, and other Git tutorials have a tendency to introduce 
                lots of heavy theory, which can be interesting to learn but in practice is really only understood by a 
                tiny handful of Git users.
              </p>               
              <p> 
                The reason why Git is essential to learn, is it's widely accepted among developers and 
                companies. Over 70% of developers use Git, making it the most used VCS in the world. Git
                is used for both open source and commercial software development.</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>
                          Git lets developers see the entire timeline of their changes, decisions, and 
                          progression of any project in one place. From the moment they access the history 
                          of a project, the developer has all the context they need to understand it and 
                          start contributing.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Developers work in every time zone. With a DVCS like Git, collaboration can happen
                          any time while maintaining source code integrity. Using branches, developers can 
                          safely propose changes to production code.
                      </li>
                      <li>Businesses using Git can break down communication barriers between teams and keep 
                          them focused on doing their best work. Plus, Git makes it possible to align experts 
                          across a business to collaborate on major projects.
                      </li>

          <header>What is a repository?</header>
            <article>
              <p>
                A repository, or Git project, encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated with a 
                project, along with each file’s revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called 
                commits, and the commits exist as a linked-list relationship, and can be organized into multiple lines 
                of development called branches. Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and anyone 
                who owns a copy of the repository can access the entire codebase and its history. Using the command line 
                or other ease-of-use interfaces, a git repository also allows for: interaction with the history, cloning, 
                creating branches, committing, merging, comparing changes across versions of code, and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working in repositories keeps development projects organized and protected. Developers are encouraged to 
                fix bugs, or create fresh features, without fear of derailing mainline development efforts. Git facilitates 
                this through the use of topic branches: lightweight pointers to commits in history that can be easily created 
                and deprecated when no longer needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through platforms like GitHub, Git also provides more opportunities for project transparency and collaboration. 
                Public repositories help teams work together to build the best possible final product.

        <section class="main-section" id="getting-started">
            <header>Getting started</header>
            <article>
              To get started using Git, we need to install it on our systems, to do so follow these instructions:
              <ol>
                <li><h2>Downloading Git</h2>
                    Go to <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git website</a> and download the appropriate 
                    git version. Within the website you will also find installation guides to use. 
                </li>
                <li><h2>Configuring Git</h2>
                    The next thing you'll want to do is to configure your name and email on Git. Git needs your 
                    identity to document the contributor whenever there is a change to the code. The two commands are 
                    as follows:
                    <code>$ git config --global user.name "Billy Programmer"</code>
                    <code>$ git config --global user.email "bprogrammer123@terpmail.umd.edu"</code>
                </li>
                <li><h2>Creating or Cloning a Git Repository</h2>
                    To turn a project into a Git repository, go inside the project folder and type the command
                    <br>
                    <code>$ git init</code>
                    to create a new Git repository. A folder to track history will be created, although there will be 
                    no other changes to your repository. If you want to clone an existing Git repository and you know 
                    the location of the respository, you can easily make a copy of the repository into your current 
                    irectory:
                    <br>
                    <code>$ git clone bprogrammer@linux.grace.umd.edu:~/216/project1</code>
                    So if we wanted to do Project 1 under version control, we would want to simply convert it into a Git 
                    repository after copying over the files.
                    <br>
                    <code>$ cp -r ~/216public/projects/project1 ~/216
                    $ cd ~/216/project1
                    $ git init</code>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </article>

                    <li>
                      <p>Run <code>git help</code> at the command line. What is the first command listed?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There’s a chance that the full output of <code>git help</code> was too big to fit in your terminal, with most of it 
                        just scrolling by. What’s the command to let us navigate the output of <code>git help</code> interactively? Hint: Pipe 
                        the output to <code>less</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Git stores global configuration settings in a hidden text file located in your home directory. By inspecting the 
                        file <code>~/.gitconfig</code> with a tool of your choice (<code>cat, less,</code> a text editor, etc.).

                  <p>
                    To use Git, developers use specific commands to copy, create, change, and combine code. These commands can be executed 
                    directly from the command line or by using an application like GitHub Desktop or Git Kraken. Here are some common commands 
                    for using Git. Please read through them first.:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <code>git init</code> initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory. It adds a hidden
                        subfolder within the existing directory that houses the internal data structure required for version control.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>git clone</code> creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project’s files, history, 
                        and branches.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>git add</code> stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer’s codebase, but it’s necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the 
                        changes to include them in the project’s history. This command performs staging, the first part of that two-step process. Any 
                        changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the project’s history. Staging and committing 
                        separately gives developers complete control over the history of their project without changing how they code and work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>git commit</code> saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit functions 
                        like taking a photo. Anything that’s been staged with <code>git add</code> will become a part of the snapshot with <code>git commit</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>git status</code>shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>git branch</code> shows the branches being worked on locally.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>git merge</code> merges lines of development together. This command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct branches. 
                        For example, a developer would merge when they want to combine changes from a feature branch into the main branch for deployment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>git pull</code> updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. Developers use this command if a teammate 
                        has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they would like to reflect those changes in their local environment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <code>git push</code> updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.
                    </li>
              </ol>

          <section class="main-section" id="gitFlow">
            <header>The GitHub flow</header>
              <article>
                  <p>The GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow built around core Git commands used by teams around the globe—including ours.</p>
                  <p>The GitHub flow has six steps, each with distinct benefits when implemented:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                          Create a branch: Topic branches created from the canonical deployment branch (usually main) allow teams to contribute to many parallel efforts. 
                          Short-lived topic branches, in particular, keep teams focused and results in quick ships.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Add commits: Snapshots of development efforts within a branch create safe, revertible points in the project’s history.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Open a pull request: Pull requests publicize a project’s ongoing efforts and set the tone for a transparent development process.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Discuss and review code: Teams participate in code reviews by commenting, testing, and reviewing open pull requests. Code review is at the core 
                          of an open and participatory culture.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Merge: Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the equivalent of a local ‘git merge’ operation. GitHub also keeps the entire branch 
                          development history on the merged pull request.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Deploy: Teams can choose the best release cycles or incorporate continuous integration tools and operate with the assurance that code on the 
                          deployment branch has gone through a robust workflow.
                      </li>
